# Changelog

## v1.3.0

- add a new `unipipe browse` command to interactively explore and update service instances. This is very useful for "semi-automated" services where operators want to manually update service instance status.
- add a new `unipipe upgrade` command that allows upgrading unipipe-cli versions when unipipe was installed via `deno install`. See [installation instructions](https://github.com/meshcloud/unipipe-service-broker/wiki/How-To-Guides#deno-install)

## v1.2.2

- integrate cli into unipipe-service-broker repository
